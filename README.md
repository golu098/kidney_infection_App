Kidney Disease also recognized as Chronic Renal Disease, is an uncharacteristic functioning of kidney or a failure of renal function expanding over a period of months or years. Habitually, chronic kidney disease is detected during the screening of people who are known to be in threat by kidney problems, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those with a blood relative Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) patients. So the early prediction is necessary in combating the disease and to provide good treatment. This study proposes the use of machine learning techniques for CKD such as Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) technique and Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier. Final output predicts whether the person is having CKD or not by using minimum number of features.

--> Performed exploratory data analysis on patient records and engineered features for higher efficiency of model.

-->Trained machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Tree Based Classifiers, Ensemble Methods.

-->Evaluated model performance of classification (accuracy and AUC) via k-fold cross-validation technique.

-->Applied grid search for hyperparameter tuning to find optimal combination of parameters.

-->Optimized the model to achieve performance of accuracy = 99% and AUC = 1.
